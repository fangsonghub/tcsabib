Often times, I've found myself in a frustrating and time-consuming
situation: I want to quickly review a topic I've read about before,
but due to bad memory, I have to almost repeat the process of my first
reading. This means wasting time on
1. search the paper online (or my cabinet of printouts) and find an
   optimal version (e.g., recent and not behind a paywall);
2. read the paper (mostly abstract and introduction) for about 15
   minutes or even longer till I gradually recall the content and some
   old thoughts (occasionally **valuable**) in earlier readings;
3. re-produce the network of related works (of course adding some new
   work that appeared after the last reading) by repeating 1 & 2, and
   finally reconstruct a mental picture of the state of art.

To save time for the sake of other fun stuff, I would like to maintain
lists of annotated bibliography on topics that interest me. For each
paper, you will find (a subset of) 
- link to free-accessible file of the paper whenever possible;
- a [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) item that is hopefully clean and
  respects a consistent style (**NB**: putting together a nice bib
  file eats up a lot of my energy every time I work on a writeup);
- a short summary including the result, the main ideas, etc.;
- personal comments or reflections.

I hope it will also be helpful to anyone who wants a quick navigation
of some of the topics here. But of course, this should only be a
jump-start for you to explore an area and distill the most relevant
information effectively (an essential skill that every researcher
needs to develop).

Thanks to all who have been and will be contributing!
