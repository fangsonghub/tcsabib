## Contributing

The site is hosted on [github](https://github.com/fangsonghub/tcsabib)
and is powered by static-site generator
[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This [blog
post](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages)
gives a great tutorial, although you absolutely don't have to know
anything about them.

All you need to get started is a bit familiarity with markdown, and
preferably a bit about [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/). 

As of now, each bibliography list is treated as a "post" in Jekyll
sitting in the "_post" directory, which is a markdown file respecting
certain formatting. 

1. make sure you follow the [naming
   convention](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) of Jekyll:
   "YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md"
2. start the markdown file with a front matter like this

```
