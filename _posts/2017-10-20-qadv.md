**Context**: one of the two major techniques for proving quantum query
lower bounds.

### Adversary method: early work
- [Amb00] **Quantum lower bounds by quantum arguments** by Andris
  Ambainis
  - [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0002066),
    [BibTeX](), [Other formats:
    [STOC00](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=335394),
    [JCSS](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002200000291826X)]
  - **Summary**: 


### Generalized (negative-weight) adversary method


### Quantum algorithms induced by adversary method

### Extensions 
  - [BBH+17] **Provably secure key establishment against quantum
    adversaries** by Aleksandrs Belovs, Gilles Brassard, Peter Hoyer,
    Marc Kaplan, Sophie Laplante, Louis Salvail
	- [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08182), [BibTeX]()
    - **Summary**: an adversary method for _average-case_ query complexity
